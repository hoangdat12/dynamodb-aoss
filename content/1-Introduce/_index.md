**Serverless** is a cloud-native development model that allows developers to build and run applications without having to manage servers.

**DynamoDB** is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. DynamoDB lets you offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling a distributed database so that you don't have to worry about hardware provisioning, setup and configuration, replication, software patching, or cluster scaling.

**OpenSearch Serverless** Amazon OpenSearch Serverless is a serverless option in Amazon OpenSearch Service. As a developer, you can use OpenSearch Serverless to run petabyte-scale workloads without configuring, managing, and scaling OpenSearch clusters. You get the same interactive millisecond response times as OpenSearch Service with the simplicity of a serverless environment.

**Kinesis Stream** is a serverless streaming data service that simplifies the capture, processing, and storage of data streams at any scale, it designed to process large-scale data streams from a multitude of services in real-time.

**Lambda** is a serverless compute service, executes your code in response to events, handling compute resources for you.

In this lab, you will gain hands-on experience with integrating Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon OpenSearch Serverless. They will learn how to effectively replicate and synchronize data across these services using stream-based mechanisms like DynamoDB Streams and Kinesis Streams.
